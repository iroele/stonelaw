<h2>Understanding Post-Conviction Relief</h2>
<p>Post-conviction relief refers to the legal processes available to individuals who have been convicted of a crime and seek to challenge the legality of their conviction or sentence after the trial has concluded.

<li>Appeals: A formal request to a higher court to review the decision of a lower court, typically based on claims of legal errors.</li>
<li>Resentencing: This option allows individuals to seek a modification of their sentence based on new evidence or changes in the law.</li>
